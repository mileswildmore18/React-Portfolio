# React Portfolio

![alt text](./src/assets/portfolio-screenshot.png)

## Description
Welcome to my portfolio! You will get a chance to see what I am all about and what I have learned thoughtout my experience of coding for websites. You also will get a chance to learn all about me and be able to explore projects I made with my team. Here I used a new tool known as React to make my portfolio professional for people to view my projects I made since the beginning of the year. While building my portfolio, I learned about how to use React to add more effects to my page, such as connecting the header, navigation bar, and footer to different pages within one file. I also featured a new animation technique to make my pages very appealing to look at as well as showing what I am capable of creating. I also learned how to connect my navigation pages with react routing to connect to other pages and to keep the codes simple and easier to navigate throughout my React portfolio page. I look forward to working with employees to build websites and to show my skills to companies!
