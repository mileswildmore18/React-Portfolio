            <p>
                My name is Miles Wildmore. I am a front end web developer who is passionate for developing websites for people. I specialize in making the pages as decorative and professional. <br />
                Originally born in England, but now live in America since 2001. I became a U.S. citizen in January of 2018, so now I am a dual citizen for U.K. and U.S. <br />
                I started web designing at the beginning of 2024 and have been dedicated in getting tasks done and never stop until I get it complete. I am tenacious and a hard worker. I am looking forward to working
                with people on designing webs and to be a team player to help any company out. <br />
                I have a passion in animation on websites to show appeal to anyone who visits particular sites and to bring a smile to any user's face when they see what I am truly capable of.
